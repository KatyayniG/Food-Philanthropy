# Food Philanthropy

According to the *National Geographic*, about 30% of the food we grow is wasted every year. However, with constant advent of new technology, newfound solutions have begun to offer solutions.

This project utilizes the Google and Postmates APIs in conjunction to provide stores an easy manner in which food and other goods can be given to those in need. 

###Workflow:
- Company goes to website and allows location services
- Company enters the company name, phone number, and description of the item
- Company chooses a food pantry to donate too
- Postmates car arrives and takes food to the pantry

Google Maps API gives us the current location of the restaurant and gives the location information about the closes food pantries.

Postmates API allows us to request a driver to deliver based on the locations received from Google.
