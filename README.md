# Food Philanthropy

According to the *National Geographic*, about 30% of the food we grow is wasted every year. However, with constant advent of new technology, newfound advances and innovations have begun to offer solutions.

This project utilizes the Google and Postmates APIs in conjunction to provide stores an easy manner in which food and other goods can be given to those in need. 

Google Maps API gives us the current location of the restaurant and gives the location information about the closes food pantries.

Postmates API allows us to request a driver to deliver based on the locations received from Google.
